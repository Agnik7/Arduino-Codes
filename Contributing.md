# Contribution Guidelines

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the "Arduino Codes" repository! We welcome contributions from the community to enhance and expand our collection of Arduino code snippets, which can be valuable for your future IoT development projects.

Please take a moment to review these guidelines before you begin:

## Code of Conduct
Before making any contributions, we kindly request that you read and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Agnik7/Arduino-Codes/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect all contributors to follow these guidelines to maintain a positive and inclusive community.

## How to Contribute

1. Start by forking the repository to your personal GitHub account.
  
2. Clone the repository from your account to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Arduino-Codes.git
```

3. Create a new branch for your work:
```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

4. Ensure that your branch is up-to-date with the `main` branch of the original repository.

5. If you wish to make changes to the existing code, simply move to the folder and change it.

6. If you wish to contribute a new code snippet, follow these steps:
  - Create a folder in the root directory of the name of the sensor or the snippet you wish to implement. The name should be written in `snake_case`. For example, if you want to submit the code implementation for using a touch sensor, your file name can be `Touch_sensor`.
  - Inside this folder, create a file with the same name as the folder name and with a `.ino` extension.
  - Write your code in this `.ino` file.

7. Edit the `README.md` file and add the link to your file in the **Table of Contents**.

8. Once you've made your additions, save your changes and run the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
git add <files you wish to add>

git commit -m "Provide a brief description of your changes here"

git push -u origin branch_name
```

9. After committing your changes, you're ready to create a pull request.

10. Create a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch of the main repository and request the project maintainer to review your changes.

11. Your pull request will be merged once your changes are approved.
